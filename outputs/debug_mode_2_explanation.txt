GTU-C312 CPU Simulator - Debug Mode 2 Explanation
==================================================

Debug Mode 2: Step-by-Step Execution
------------------------------------

Debug Mode 2 provides step-by-step execution where the simulator pauses after each instruction
and waits for user input (Enter key) before proceeding to the next instruction.

Usage:
------
make run-step
OR
./bin/gtu_c312_cpu OS/os.txt -D 2

Features:
---------
- Shows memory state after each instruction
- Waits for user confirmation before each step
- Perfect for detailed debugging and instruction tracing
- Allows examination of how each instruction affects memory
- Useful for understanding program flow and state changes

Output Format:
--------------
For each instruction execution:
1. Memory dump showing current state
2. "Press Enter to continue..." prompt
3. Waits for user input

This mode is ideal for:
-----------------------
- Debugging complex algorithms step by step
- Understanding thread context switching
- Examining memory changes in detail
- Educational purposes to see how each instruction works
- Identifying where programs might be going wrong

Note: This mode requires interactive input and is not suitable for automated testing
or output redirection to files.

For non-interactive debugging, use Debug Mode 1 (memory dump after each instruction)
or Debug Mode 3 (thread table monitoring during system calls).
